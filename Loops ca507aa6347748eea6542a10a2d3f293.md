# Loops

Loops offer a quick way to do something repeatedly. There are many different  kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat  an action some number of times. The various loop mechanisms  offer different ways to determine the start and endpoint of loop.

for statement

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C  for loop. A for statement looks as follows:

JS

for(initialization; condition; afterthought)

The doâ€¦.while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates  to false.

A do. While statement looks as follows:

JS

do statement

while(condition);

while statement 

A while statement executes  its statement as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks  as follows:

while(condition)

statement

if the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the  statement following the loop.

The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.

Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.

When you use break without a label,  it terminates the innermost enclosing while, do-while ,for, or switch immediately and transfers control to the following statement. 

When you use break with a label, it  terminates  the specified labeled statement. 

The  continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for or label statement.

When you use continue without a label, it terminates the current iteration of the innermost enclosing while, do-while, or for statement and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration.
