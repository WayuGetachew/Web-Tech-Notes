# JavaScript Data Types

Java script provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript

1. Primitive data types
2. Non-primitive data types(Object References)

Java script is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc.. For example:

var a=40;

var b=Cat;

JavaScript primitive data types

There are five types of primitive data types in Javascript. They are as follows:

Data Type                                                      Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

String                                                           represents sequence of characters e.g. hello

Number                                                       represents numeric values   e.g.          100

Boolean                                                       represents boolean value either true or false

Undefined                                                    represents undefined value

Null                                                               represents null

The   non  primitive data types are as  follows

Data   Type                                                       Description               

Object                                                       represents instance through which we can access members                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

Array                                                          represents  group of  similar values              

Reg Exp                                                         represents regular expression
